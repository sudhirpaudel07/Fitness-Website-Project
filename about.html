        <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
        <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
      
        <dt>Burpee</dt>
        <dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, 
          and then jump up from a squatted position. <span class="viewex" onclick="burpees()"> View Example.</span> </dd>
      
        <dt>Plank</dt>
        <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.</dd>
      
        <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
        <dd>Mountain Climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
